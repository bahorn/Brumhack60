To build this, you need Flask, Flask-SocketIO, gevant, gevant-websocket.
This provides a couple of things:
The core websocket server used to proxy everything to browsers.
static/code.html, which provides a basic slide show thing.
and the base app which was used to test our swipe gesture. (It shows rare pepes)
